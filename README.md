# PRODIGY_CS_01

Welcome to PRODIGY_CS_01! This is a project that aims to allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

## Function

The caesar cipher encryption function works on the following:
1. Takes 'text' and 'shift' as inputs.
2. Iterates through each character in the text.
3. If the character is a letter, it calculates the shifted position and converts it back to a character.
4. If the character is not a letter, it remains unchanged.
5. Returns the encrypted text.

The decrpyt function works similar to the encrypt function but subtracts the shift amount to reverse the encryption.

## Usage

1. Encrypts the plaintext "PRODIGY INFOTECH" with a shift of 4 to "tvshmkc mrjsxigl".
2. Decrypts the encrypted text back to the original plaintext "prodigy infotech".



## Encrypting and Decrypting Messages

In this project, we have included a Python file called `encryption.py` that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using a specific algorithm. To use this feature, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd PRODIGY_CS_01`
3. Run the `casercipher.py` file: `C:\Users\tgrac\OneDrive\Desktop\Cybersecurity\caesarcipher.py`
4. Follow the prompts to enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
5. The program will output the encrypted or decrypted message.

Happy coding!
